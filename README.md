# keylio

## Motivation
Everyone types differently.
We spend different amounts of time holding down keys and transitioning from one key to another.
Some research even suggests that the way we type could even be used to identify us, like a fingerprint.
This app was created as a fun way for people to learn about their typing style while building a profile of the 'human typing genome'
